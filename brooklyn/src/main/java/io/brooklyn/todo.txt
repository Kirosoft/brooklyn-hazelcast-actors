TODO

- Tomcat:the tomcatdriver.isRunning method

- Tomcat:deploying of an artifact

- Tomcat:undeploy of an artifact

- with the namespace stuff concurrent behavior is a bit unclear; e.g. it could be that you miss the registration

- web cluster should not be hard connected to tomcat.

- managementcontext: the 'application properties' should be available from the management context.

- concurrent startups from tomcat on the same machine cause problems due to free port conflicts.

IDEAS

- currently all attributes are written to hazelcast. Some attributes could be transient

- tomcat artifacts can automatically be discovered

- pass through messages? e.g. webcluster can register certain messages as pass through messages and will automatically
be send to all children.

- the attributes are stored with the attribute name as key; this means that there will not be any data affinity.
So we need to store the attributes on the partition key.

DONE

- driver is now selected based on location inference.

- make use of the PortRange

- the Location is now responsible for determining the free port based on the port range.

- make use of the original brooklyn location

- sshmachinelocation: fix the key

- sshmachinelocation: waiting for command completion.

- location is now passed using start message

- added sshj for remoting.

- use a config object to create entities.

- active object implementation

- the webcluster should configure the ports of its tomcat instances correctly so that multiple instances
can run in parallel.

- when an entity is created, automatically the properties should be copied to the attributes.

- Tomcat is able to stop

- Brooklyn: Only when there is a change in the value of the Attribute, then a change happens. So no call
to the HazelcastMap or to the subscribers.

- Brooklyn: The initial value of the attribute is send to the listeners and not only when a change happens.

- Brooklyn: Can now listen to BasicAttributes.
