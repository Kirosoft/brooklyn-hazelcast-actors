TODO

- when an entity is created, automatically the properties should be copied to the attributes.

DONE

- Brooklyn: Only when there is a change in the value of the Attribute, then a change happens. So no call
to the HazelcastMap or to the subscribers.

- Brooklyn: The initial value of the attribute is send to the listeners and not only when a change happens.

- Brooklyn: Can now listen to BasicAttributes.
