TODO

- the location of the entity is now hard coded.

- the tomcatdriver.isRunning method

- deploying of an artifact

- undeploy of an arifact

- with the namespace stuff concurrent behavior is a bit unclear; e.g. it could be that you miss the registration

- integrate with jclouds

- web cluster should not be hard connected to tomcat.

IDEAS

- currently all attributes are written to hazelcast. Some attributes could be transient

- tomcat artifacts can automatically be discovered

- pass through messages? e.g. webcluster can register certain messages as pass through messages and will automatically
be send to all children.

DONE

- use a config object to create entities.

- active object implementation

- the webcluster should configure the ports of its tomcat instances correctly so that multiple instances
can run in parallel.

- when an entity is created, automatically the properties should be copied to the attributes.

- Tomcat is able to stop

- Brooklyn: Only when there is a change in the value of the Attribute, then a change happens. So no call
to the HazelcastMap or to the subscribers.

- Brooklyn: The initial value of the attribute is send to the listeners and not only when a change happens.

- Brooklyn: Can now listen to BasicAttributes.
